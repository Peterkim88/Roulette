LIGHTNING ROULETTE

  This game plays the same as the classic version of roulette with a few minor changes.
The biggest change is a new 'lightning' feature that randomly chooses numbers every round
after players are barred from placing further bets. If the roulette ball lands on these
lightning numbers, the payout will be the preassigned multiplier rather than the regular

  The next biggest change is in the payouts. Non-lightning number hits will be paid out 
lower than the standard to even out the multiplier aspect of the game. The higher the
multipliers that are available will mean regular hits will have a lower payout.
